## Overview

This project's main goal is to find effective tactics that can boost customer engagement and encourage more orders from customers at various retail establishments. Each of the three datasets that have been made available offers insightful data on consumer preferences and purchasing patterns at these retail establishments. We want to learn more about how customers interact with stores, their purchasing patterns, and the factors that have a big impact on those decisions by carefully analyzing this data.
## Project Highlights

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure of the dataset.
- Visualization of sales trends, customer demographics, and product categories.
- Predictive modeling to forecast future sales or customer demand.
- Insights into popular products, peak shopping times, and customer preferences.
- Recommendations for business strategies based on data-driven findings.

## Overview

This project's main goal is to find effective tactics that can boost customer engagement and encourage more orders from customers at various retail establishments. Each of the three datasets that have been made available offers insightful data on consumer preferences and purchasing patterns at these retail establishments. We want to learn more about how customers interact with stores, their purchasing patterns, and the factors that have a big impact on those decisions by carefully analyzing this data.
## Project Highlights

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure of the dataset.
- Visualization of sales trends, customer demographics, and product categories.
- Predictive modeling to forecast future sales or customer demand.
- Insights into popular products, peak shopping times, and customer preferences.
- Recommendations for business strategies based on data-driven findings.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Retail , a fictional retail store. It includes information on sales transactions, product details, customer demographics, and more. The dataset is available in CSV format and is preprocessed for analysis.

## Installation

To run the analysis code, you'll need Python 3.7+ and the following libraries:


## After Building the model, and now the model is good.

1. Mean Squared Error (MSE):
MSE is a common metric used to evaluate regression models. It measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values. A lower MSE indicates better performance, as it means the model's predictions are closer to the actual values. In this case, the model's MSE is approximately 541301.11, which indicates that, on average, the squared difference between the predicted and actual values is quite large.

2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
MAE is another metric used to evaluate regression models. It measures the average absolute difference between the predicted values and the actual values. Like MSE, a lower MAE indicates better performance, as it means the model's predictions are closer to the actual values. In this case, the model's MAE is approximately 547.11, which means, on average, the absolute difference between the predicted and actual values is around 547.

3. R-squared (R2) Score:
The R-squared (R2) score is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of variance in the target variable that is predictable from the input features. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit and 0 indicates the model's predictions are no better than simply predicting the mean of the target variable. In this case, the model's R2 score is approximately 0.9479, indicating that the model explains around 94.79% of the variance in the target variable, which is quite good.

Now, let's look at the cross-validation results:

Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the model's performance more reliably by splitting the dataset into multiple subsets (folds) and training/evaluating the model on different combinations of these subsets. The reported cross-validation results show the performance of the model on each fold as well as the overall performance.

The cross-validation is done using k-fold cross-validation, where k = 5 (i.e., 5 folds). The reported results for each fold include MSE, MAE, and R2 score. The average of these metrics across all folds provides an overall estimation of the model's performance during cross-validation.

Based on the cross-validation results:

- The average MSE across all folds is approximately 198335.01, which is lower than the overall MSE of the model, indicating that the model's performance during cross-validation is slightly better than when evaluated on the entire dataset.

- The average MAE across all folds is approximately 305.58, which is also lower than the overall MAE of the model.

- The average R2 score across all folds is approximately 0.9810, which is very close to the overall R2 score, indicating a consistent and reliable model performance during cross-validation.

Finally, the model's performance is also assessed on a separate test set. The reported test set results show that the model performs well on unseen data, with a Test Set MSE of approximately 187802.37, Test Set MAE of approximately 300.07, and a Test Set R2 Score of approximately 0.9819.

Overall, the model seems to be performing quite well with relatively low prediction errors and a high R2 score, indicating that it is capable of explaining a significant portion of the target variable's variance. However, it's important to consider the specific context and requirements of the problem being addressed to determine whether this performance is satisfactory.

## For further improvement in the model we can also introduce PCA
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a popular technique used in machine learning and data analysis to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while retaining as much of the data's variance as possible. By projecting high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional subspace, PCA can help reveal the underlying structure and patterns in the data.

Here is a detailed description of the PCA process:

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Standardization: If the dataset contains features with different scales, it is crucial to standardize the data (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1) before applying PCA. This step ensures that all features contribute equally to the analysis.

2. Covariance Matrix Calculation:
   - PCA begins by computing the covariance matrix of the standardized data. The covariance matrix represents the relationships between different features in the dataset. The element at position (i, j) in the covariance matrix represents the covariance between feature i and feature j.

3. Eigenvector-Eigenvalue Decomposition:
   - Once the covariance matrix is obtained, the next step is to perform an eigendecomposition (eigenvector-eigenvalue decomposition) on the covariance matrix. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are computed.
   - The eigenvectors represent the principal components of the data, which are the directions of maximum variance. The corresponding eigenvalues represent the amount of variance explained by each principal component.
   - The eigenvectors are sorted in descending order based on their corresponding eigenvalues. This means that the first eigenvector (principal component) corresponds to the direction of the highest variance in the data, the second eigenvector corresponds to the second-highest variance, and so on.

4. Selection of Principal Components:
   - To reduce the dimensionality of the data, you select the top k eigenvectors (principal components) that capture the most significant variance in the data. These k components form the lower-dimensional subspace that will be used to represent the data.

5. Projection of Data:
   - The final step is to project the original data onto the selected principal components to obtain the lower-dimensional representation of the data.
   - Each data point is transformed by taking the dot product with the selected k eigenvectors, effectively projecting it onto the lower-dimensional subspace.

The benefits of using PCA include:
- Dimensionality Reduction: PCA helps in reducing the number of features (dimensions) while retaining most of the important information from the original data.
- Data Visualization: By transforming data into a lower-dimensional space, PCA enables the visualization of data points in two or three dimensions, making it easier to observe patterns and clusters.
- Noise Reduction: PCA can remove noise and irrelevant information by focusing on the directions of highest variance, which often capture the most significant patterns in the data.

PCA is widely used in various fields, such as image processing, genetics, finance, and many other domains, to facilitate data analysis and visualization.

### About The Project


This project's main goal is to find effective tactics that can boost customer engagement and encourage more orders from customers at various retail establishments. Each of the three datasets that have been made available offers insightful data on consumer preferences and purchasing patterns at these retail establishments. We want to learn more about how customers interact with stores, their purchasing patterns, and the factors that have a big impact on those decisions by carefully analyzing this data.

### Built With

### Features:

•	Completed: We predicted Company's order (we can predict the company's orders using the data and analysis conducted in the project. The process involves leveraging insights gained from customer segmentation, product performance analysis, predictive analytics, and other relevant factors.)
•	To-Do: Need to evaluate the cost Data Set

### Project Status:

On final Stage . Need to evaluate the cost data set to windup the Project.


Adding the Visualizations on Tableau public as a link : https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/akshay.ajeesh7816/viz/RetaildataVisualisation/Dashboard1?publish=yes

The retail data visualization is done in Tableau public. Therefore, attached the link to my account for the visualization. 
Description about the visualization : 
   The first graph is regarding the orders and the dates. The number of orders recieved in each and every month.
   The number of school holidays recieved in our database  is 116484 as compared to the school days that is 534529
   The next graph is the number of customers from each store
   The variation of customers in days of week shows that the number of customers declined drastically on the 7th day of the week
   The next circle graph shows the customers count in competions from last month.

The features are dynamic. Which means, the graphs depend on the click of other graphs.
